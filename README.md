## Introduction

I am using [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) as the packaging / dependency manager, since it is modern and practical and follows the build system standard set by [PEP-517](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0517/).

### Data

* Choose data for selected mushrooms
* If unbalanced, scrape for more data
* Scrape for more training data [long-term]
### Model
* Attempt k-fold cross validation instead of standard data split
